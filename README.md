# Overview
We developed a Java Compiler Application using Java NetBeans with Apache, implementing key components of a compiler such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The application processes source code to identify tokens, validate grammatical structure, and ensure logical correctness, simulating the core functions of a typical compiler.
